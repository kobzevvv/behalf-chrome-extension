# 🚀 Deployment Fix - Durable Objects Issue

## ❌ Current Error
```
Version upload failed. You attempted to upload a version of a Worker that includes a Durable Object migration, but migrations must be fully applied by running "wrangler deploy".
```

## ✅ Solution
For Durable Objects, the **first deployment** must use `wrangler deploy`, not `wrangler versions upload`.

## 🔧 Fix Required
Change your deployment command from:
```bash
npx wrangler versions upload
```

To:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## 📋 Deployment Steps
1. **Initial Durable Object Deployment**: `wrangler deploy`
2. **Subsequent Updates**: Can use `wrangler versions upload`

## 🎯 Next Action
Update your deployment configuration to use `wrangler deploy` for this initial deployment with Durable Objects.

**This should resolve the deployment error immediately!** 🚀
